It can still be accessed from outside, but it's a warning to avoid doing so.\n",

Python internally renames these attributes to avoid name conflicts in subclasses, a process called name mangling. This makes it difficult, but not impossible, to access them from outside the class. It's the closest thing Python has to a private access modifier."

        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism is important in OOP because it makes code flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain. It allows us to write code that can work with a variety of objects in a uniform way, without needing to know their specific type at compile time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code Reusability: Polymorphism allows us to write a single piece of code that can operate on different objects\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Simplified Interface: It simplifies the interface of our code. Instead of having to write different functions for each type of object (e.g., calculate_square_area(), calculate_circle_area()), we can use a single, generalized method that works for all of them. This makes our code cleaner and more intuitive\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Decoupling: Polymorphism helps decouple the code. The calling code (e.g., the function that calls calculate_area()) doesn't need to be tightly coupled to the specific implementation of each subclass. This means we can add new subclasses without having to modify the existing code that uses the common interface\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Improved Readability: Code that utilizes polymorphism is often more readable and logical because it models real-world concepts more accurately."

        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method chaining is a programming technique that allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single, continuous line of code. It works by having each method return a reference to the same object, so the next method call can operate on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This technique, also known as cascading, makes code more concise and readable, especially when performing a series of operations on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of Method Chaining:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Concise and Readable Code: It reduces the number of lines of code and makes the sequence of operations clear at a glance\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Fluent Interface: It creates a \"fluent\" or \"fluent API\" where the code reads like a sentence, improving its expressiveness\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Reduced Temporary Variables: It eliminates the need for temporary variables to hold intermediate results\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is a common pattern in Python libraries like Pandas, which makes data manipulation operations clean and intuitive.\n"

        "-> The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an object to be treated and called like a function. When you define __call__ in a class, you can use the instance of that class as if it were a regular function.\n",
